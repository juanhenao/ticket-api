# Ticket API

A basic Ticket API and Small Frontend

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+)
2. Run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images
3. Run `docker compose up` (the logs will be displayed in the current shell)
4. Run `npm install` in the container
5. Run the frontend dev server with `yarn encore dev-server`
6. Open `https://localhost/home` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334) to see the frontend
7. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
